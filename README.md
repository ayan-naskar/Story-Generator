# Any Bugs?
The Shakespearan Romance Genre story is a bit buggy and might not always
run in the proper manner.

Reason: The text file from which it generates the story upon has abnormal indentation 
and unnecessary white spaces. This was due to lack of proper handing of the original
text file.

Any fix: It can be easily fixed by removing the excess white spaces and new lines.

Why is it not fixed?
	-- Removing white spaces is a bit tiring and unmotivating. Moreover other genres work
	perfectly fine. The bug will be fixed soon or the genre for shakespear will be removed
	completely.
